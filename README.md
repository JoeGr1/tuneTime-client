# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Welcome

Welcome to the tuneTime. repositery. this readme. covers set up for the who application including this client repository as well as the server repository, which can be fouond at: https://github.com/JoeGr1/tuneTime-server

tuneTime is a song sharing app desiggn for sharing users surrnelty listening to. this feature uses spotifies Oauth2.0 to get permisions. a spotify account is needed for the development and use of this app. For developemnt, all data will be stored locally to yoour local Databse.

### Database

ensure that your local machine can run a MySQL2 database, and create a database called "tuneTime_db" and update values in .env file to your own details.

### For Seeding data 'npm run full'

Check package.json for knex scripts regarding migrations, rollback, and seeding. 'npm run full' will rollback last migration, migrate new tables, and then seed the data into the new tables.

### for .env

for client and server .env values please contact JoeGr1 (repository creater). He will provide the sensitive data needed to run the app (DO NOT SHARE THIS DATA AT ALL, DO NOT CHANGE .env.example)

### npm install

after cloning reposittry to local device, ensure you install all the rlevant librabris used in both client folder and server folder.

you can see a list of libraires used in package.json under 'dependencies', if in doubt run npm i <dependency>.
